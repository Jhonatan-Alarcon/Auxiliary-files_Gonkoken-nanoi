1. S1 corresponds to a matrix of morphological (osteological) characters of hadrosauroid dinosaurs (herbivores known as "duck-billed dinosaurs") in ".nex" format. This matrix was used to determine the phylogenetic relationships of hadrosauroids, with special interest in those that lived in South America. 

2. S2 corresponds to a file in ".out" format containing the list of synapomorphies and characters supporting the nodes of the phylogenetic trees obtained from parsimony analysis in the TNT (Tree analysis using New Technology) program. It should be noted that some synapomorphies may be ambiguous.

3. S3 corresponds to the codes used for BioGeoBEARS. This script is executed in the R program and allows to reconstruct the biogeographic history of organisms from their phylogenetic relationships. For more information, see: Matzke, Nicholas J. (2018). BioGeoBEARS: BioGeography with Bayesian (and likelihood) Evolutionary Analysis with R Scripts. version 1.1.1, published on GitHub on November 6, 2018. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1478250.

4. S4 corresponds to a dispersion matrix for hadrosauroids that takes into account the variability of connections between land masses (.txt). The numbers represent the relative weights between the different areas. Weights were derived from: 0.75 for land masses with extensive evidence of faunal exchange; 0.5 for land masses where there is evidence for limited exchange; 0.1 for dispersal routes with little fossil evidence for exchange; and 0 for distances presumed too great for dispersal (Longrich et al., 2021). This information was used in the biogeographical analysis with BioGeoBEARS. For more information see: N. R. Longrich, X. Pereda Suberbiola, A. R. Pyron, J. Nour-Eddine, The first duck-billed dinosaur (Hadrosauridae: Lambeosaurinae) from Africa and the role of oceanic dispersal in dinosaur biogeography. Cretac. Res. 120, 104678 (2021).

5. S5 is a file in ".txt" format containing information on the geographic location of the hadrosauroids in the S1 matrix. This information was used in the biogeographical analysis with BioGeoBEARS. A: Asia, B: Europe, C: Laramidia, D: Appalachia, E: South America. F: Africa.

6. S6 is a file in ".nex.tprobs" format containing the posterior probability of each of the trees obtained in the Bayesian analysis in which the maximum and minimum age for each hadrosauroid was not incorporated (undated analysis).

7. S7 is a file in ".nex.tprobs" format containing the posterior probability of each of the trees obtained in the Bayesian analysis in which the maximum and minimum age for each hadrosauroid was incorporated (dated analysis).

8. S8 is a file in ".xlsx" format containing the FAD (First Appareance Datum) and LAD (Last Appareance Datum) for each taxon contained in the morphological matrix S1. In addition, the references from which this information was extracted are included. These ages were used in the phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses (BioGeoBEARS).
